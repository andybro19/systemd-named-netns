# systemd-named-netns

This project enables you to:
 * Create and delete named netns on the fly like systemd services
 * Start named netns on boot
 * Quickly set up bridging from netns to host
 * Use named netns in systemd services
   * Enables them to connect to the internet too
   * And you can manually switch to its netns (since they are named)

## Installation

Dependencies:
 * Recent version of systemd (newer is better; tested down to v232)
 * iproute2
 * iptables (only if you use default NAT config)
 * `/usr/bin/env`

For installation, run `make install` with root privilege.

You ran run `make uninstall` to remove the systemd units, but the configs located in `/etc/default` will not be removed.

## Quickstart

```shell
systemctl start netns-nat@helloworld
chnetns helloworld ip address
```
